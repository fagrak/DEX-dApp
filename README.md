# DEX-dApp

This project's origin is the LearnWeb3 Sophomore course. The title is "Build your own Decentralized Exchange like Uniswap"

This is a decentralized exchange project that allows participants to add liquidity to a single asset pair, ETH/Crypto Dev, and swap between them. The project charges a 1% fee on swaps and provides users with Crypto Dev LP tokens when they add liquidity. These LP tokens are proportional to the amount of ETH added to the liquidity pool.
